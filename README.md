# Finance_Calculator

## Above calculator is the result of my practice.
Base task I started with was getting some input about tax rate and monthly income 
then outputting monthly and yearly tax to pay and how much money will you finally acquire.

That would be too easy assuming that learning is based on trying new things and getting past them.
Soo I've made a list what to do or what try to do.

## Here's the list:

- [ ] Use any framework to build a GUI which will contain:
     - [X] Menu
                    - [X] Exit button 
     - [X] Output Window
          - [X] Possibility of returning to menu
     - [ ] Make the GUI look like not from 1990
		- [ ] Center elements within windows
		- [ ] Choose eye-friendly colors
		- [ ] Set the size of text big enough for larger resolutions ex. 1080x720

- [X] Make sure that app won't crash whenever data type don't match the right one

- [ ] Let the user add their own expenses like loan or subscription 
	 - [ ] Up to 2 custom positions
		- [ ] Subscripton
		- [ ] Loan

- [ ] **\(optional)** Create a simple database with login, password and history of past operations
	- [ ] You'll be given a template of database and short instruction on how to connect to your database

### Framework I'm working with is Tkinter
### DBMS is SQLAlchemy within FastAPI
