# Finance_Calculator

## Above calculator is the result of my practice.
Base task I started with was getting some input about tax rate and monthly income 
then outputing monthly and yearly tax to pay and how much money will you finally acquire.

That would be too easy assuming that learning is based on trying new things and getting past them.
Soo I've made a list what to do or what try to do.

## Here's the list:

- [ ] Use any framework to build a GUI which will contain:
     - [x] Menu
     - [x] Output Window
          - [x] Possibility of returning to menu
     - [ ] Make the GUI look good

- [x] Make sure that app won't crash whenever data type don't match the right one

- [ ] Let the user add their own expenses like loan or subscription or anything like that

- [ ] Make a currency menu and let the user decide which one to use

- [ ] **\(optional)** Create a simple database with login, password and history of past operations

### Framework I'm working with is Tkinter
