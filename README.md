# Finance_Calculator

## Above calculator is the result of my practice.
Base task I started with was getting some input about tax rate and monthly income 
then outputting monthly and yearly tax to pay and how much money will you finally acquire. But that was too easy soo I've managed to expand the requirement a bit. You'll find out how much you spent on taxes per month and year. How much does your subscriptions and loans (if you have one) takes from your account. Wide choice of currencies to choose.
